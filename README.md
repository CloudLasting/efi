# EFI

My personal OpenCore EFI configuration. Using [https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg](Opencore 0.5.7)

Based on examples at [https://www.technolli.com](Technolli) and tweaked based on various examples on hackintosh forums.

## Current System

* Ryzen 3600
* Gigabyte Aorus x570i Pro Wifi
* Gigabyte 5600XT Windforce
* Seagate FireCuda 520
* 32GB RAM!

## Whats working

I haven't tested everything yet... like sleep, etc.

- [x] Installs and boots
- [x] HDMI Sound
- [x] Ethernet
- [x] Apple Services
- [ ] Bluetooth seems patchy
- [ ] Wifi (expected, this chipset is not supported. Not a concern right now)

## BIOS Tweaks

* Set to optimizsed defaults

* Disable CSM
