# EFI

My personal OpenCore EFI configuration. Using [Opencore 0.5.7](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg)

Based on examples by [Technolli](https://www.technolli.com) and tweaked based on various examples on hackintosh forums.

## Current System

* Ryzen 3600
* Gigabyte Aorus x570i Pro Wifi
* Gigabyte 5600XT Windforce
* Seagate FireCuda 520
* 32GB RAM!

## Whats working

I haven't tested everything yet... like sleep, etc.

- [x] Installs and boots
- [x] HDMI Sound
- [x] Ethernet
- [x] Apple Services
- [ ] Bluetooth - connects, but seems patchy. AirPods dropping, etc
- [ ] Wifi (Expected, this chipset is not supported. Not a concern right now)

## BIOS Tweaks

* Set to optimizsed defaults
* Disable CSM

Note that these files have my serials removed, so you will have to update them.
